# Project coding standards for Svelte

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## Svelte 5 Guidelines
- Ensure that Svelte Components are utilizing the Svelte 5 syntax. 
- Make sure that all Svelte components utilize Rune Mode within Svelte 5.
- Review all Svelte components and ensure that they are consistent, as well as combined as much as possible. 
- Ensure that any components that can be combined into a single component with expanded functionality are combined.
